✨ What Is VerseCraft?

VerseCraft is designed as a story engine, not just a single game.

At its core, it supports:
	•	Branching narrative paths
	•	Story packs and modules
	•	Archetype-driven perspectives
	•	Inventory, stats, and progression (engine-backed)
	•	Touch-first navigation using invisible hitboxes
	•	Strong visual framing using illustrated UI panels and skins

Think of it as a foundation for:
	•	Narrative RPGs
	•	Interactive fiction
	•	Episodic story worlds
	•	Creator-driven story packs

📱 Platform Focus
	•	Primary target: Mobile browsers (iOS Safari)
	•	Secondary: Desktop browsers (for testing/debug)
	•	Deployment: GitHub Pages
	•	Offline/PWA support: Planned

The UI is intentionally built mobile-first, including:
	•	Safe-area awareness (notches / dynamic island)
	•	Tap-optimized hitboxes
	•	Minimal reliance on traditional buttons
