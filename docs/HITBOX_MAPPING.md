# Hitbox Mapping

Hitboxes are defined in:
- /styles/ui/hitboxes.css

Workflow:
1) Enable debug mode: click Debug (footer) or open `?debug=1`
2) Adjust % positions for each hitbox block
3) Commit & push
4) Retest on iOS Safari

DO NOT add transforms/scale to screen containers.
Keep backgrounds as <img> with object-fit: cover.
